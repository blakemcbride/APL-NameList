⍝ The following information applies to the APL Package Manager release
⍝ named "Netochka".
⍝
⍝ A package consists of a directory which in turn contains files or
⍝ other directories. The files, with the exception of the control and
⍝ metadata files, may contain anything. The directories may be used to
⍝ organize other files and directories in any manner. The only requirements
⍝ of the packaging scheme are the top-level directory (nominally named for
⍝ the package) and the control and metadata files.
⍝
⍝ For purposes of transport and distribution, a package may be bundled
⍝ in a .zip file. The zip file should bear the name of the package
⍝ directory.
⍝
⍝ A package may be installed via other means, such as from a version
⍝ control repository such as used by svn or git. The presence of version
⍝ control data in the package directory shall not influence the function
⍝ of the package manager.
⍝ 
⍝ The package control file is just a Unicode representation of a valid
⍝ APL program. The control file may be complete in and of itself or
⍝ may run code to construct, load and install the package using additional
⍝ files and tools.
⍝
⍝ A package may depend on other packages, but must not access or
⍝ create files in other package directories.
⍝
⍝ It's perfectly fine for a package to read or install files in
⍝ locations other than in package directories. Of course, you must
⍝ qualify external locations based upon platform probes.
⍝
⍝ The following table lists the API functions that you may use to
⍝ facilitate loading of a package. Refer to API.md for detailed
⍝ descriptions.

⍝ Phases
⍝ ------
⍝ Q: Query - Determine the presence of the package manager via
⍝   `0≠⎕nc 'pkg∆manager'`.
⍝ L: Load-time - These functions may only be called during package
⍝    loading.
⍝ R: Run-time - These functions may be called at package run time if
⍝    guarded by a query for package manager presence. These functions
⍝    may also be called during package loading.
