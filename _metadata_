# This is not an APL file. This is metadata for an APL package.
#
# The following information applies to the APL Package Manager release
# named "Netochka".
#
# A package's metadata is a collection of keyword/value pairs.
#
# The metadata file defines keyword/value pairs. A keyword is the
# first word on a line, followed by a ':' character. The keyword maybe
# preceeded by spaces. There must be no whitespace between the word
# and the ':' delimiter. The delimiter must be followed by at least
# one space.
#
# The value is the remaining text on the line (following the keyword
# and ':' character) after stripping leading and trailing spaces.
#
# A value may be extended across multiple lines. Each non-comment
# line which contains non-empty text is appended to the value.
# The platform-specific newline is preserved. The usual rule
# about stripping leading and trailing blanks applies even on
# continuation lines.
#
# Do not use tabs. Use spaces. (This limitation probably won't be
# lifted. Tabs simply aren't worth the trouble from the standpoint of
# presenting text in other contexts.)
#
# Use only the ISO-8859-1 character set. This is metatdata, not APL
# code. Putting extended characters into this file will cause
# problems, as the file may be processed through the APL's quad-AV.

# ================================================================

# The package's directory name, package_name, and package_prefix
# may all be different.

# A package name must contain only lowercase alphabetic characters
# plus (optionally) '_' and '-'. The first character of a package name
# must be alphabetic.
#
package_name: apl-nlf

# The package manager confirms that prefixes won't collide when
# loading multiple packages into the APL workspace. A prefix should be
# composed entirely of alphabetic characters. Refer to API.md for
# additional rules about the use of prefixes in APL programs to be
# loaded by the package manager.
#
package_prefix: nlf

# The version is a sequence of up to four nonnegative integers. The
# numbers are limited three, three, four and four significant digits.
#
package_version: 0 0 1

# A package may depend upon other packages, identified by package
# name. Use a separate entry for each package.
#
depends_on: 

# This is the date of the package's creation. Use YYYY-MM-DD format.

# Keywords can help to identify packages. Use one entry for each
# keyword.

keyword: set-based workspace name search
